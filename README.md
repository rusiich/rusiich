## 🧠 About Me

I’m transitioning into Data Science with a strong analytical background and deep motivation to solve business problems using data. My goal is to become a highly competent specialist in machine learning and AI.

I'm currently studying at [Yandex.Practicum](https://practicum.yandex.ru/) in the Data Science track and applying my skills at the [Territory Development Fund](https://фрт.рф), where I work on practical data-related tasks and contribute to the organization's mission through analytics and process optimization.

💡 **Why Data Science?**  
I love turning complex data into clear insights and automating solutions. Data Science combines logic, creativity, and impact — and that inspires me daily.

🛠 **Next goals:**  
- Find a remote data role to grow and make an impact
